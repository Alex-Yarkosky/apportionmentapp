# Apportionment App

## About

Part of an undergraduate senior project on United States apportionment methods; used to do analysis for *Satisfactory Justification of the United Statesâ€™ Apportionment* undergraduate senior thesis paper. The application can calculate apportionments for any appropriate house size and any Census from 1900 to 2010 with the following methods:

* Hamilton
* Jefferson
* Lowndes
* Adams
* Webster
* Dean
* Huntington-Hill

Apportionment can be done individually with results displayed in the terminal or they can be done en masse with results outputted in a CSV file. En masse apportionment can either be for a range of house sizes or be done for each Census from 1900 to 2010. En masse apportionment outputs the method name, census year, house size, and the average constituency size for the full apportionment on each line of the CSV file.
